WordPress 2.6+ and bbPress 0.9 cookie integration.

== Description ==

This plugin is for WordPress 2.6 and up. It enables WordPress to generate cookies that work with bbPress 0.9 so that single sign-on can be accomplished between the two. Follow the [usual integration instructions](http://bbpress.org/forums/topic/wordpress-and-bbpress-integration-101) and enable this plugin in your WordPress installation. I also advise clearing your cookies.

Necessary plugin functions were copied and pasted directly from WordPress 2.5.1 pluggable.php. Kudos to WordPress for making it easy!

== Installation ==

1. Upload `bbpress-integration.php` to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress
